# School_District_Analysis
Perform analysis on student data from various schools using Pandas library

## Purpose of the project
This project is to do the following works:
  * Collect the student data from a .csv dataset
  * Prepare a cleaned version of the dataset
  * Summarize key pieces of the data
  * Drill down into the data to analyze specific subsets
  * Compare and contrast the data through grouping and aggregation functions.

## Report findings
The following discoveries made while performing the analysis:
  * The dataset contained data with null values and duplicates. These records have been removed from the dataset before performing the analysis
  * The average budget for Public schools is greater than Charter schools
  * Montgomery High School is the largest school with 2038 students and Chang High school has the least number of students of 171
  * The average math score of all schools is 64.67 and the minimum reading score of all schools is 10.5
  * The average math scores of students in Charter schools are greater than those in Public schools, except for Grade 12. The average math score of Grade 12 in Charter schools is less than Grade 12's of Public schools, which is 60 and 64 respectively
  * The student with the lowest reading score is a Grade 10 student from a Charter school, which is Dixon High School.
 
It would be worthwhile if the analysis above includes a calculation for the average reading score by grade for each school type so that we can evaluate the reading skills of students in each grade in Charter and Public school.
